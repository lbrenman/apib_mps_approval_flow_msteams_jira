# Axway Marketplace Subscription Approval Request Workflow using API Builder and MS Teams

This API Builder project implements the steps described [**here**](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/amplify-central/page/docs/integrate_with_central/webhook/marketplace_subscription_webhook/index.html) to approve Axway Marketplace subscription approval requests. It leverages Jira to file an incident with custom fields for approval and MS Teams to notify the approval team with links to the incident, product, subscription and subscriber:

This project has the following features:

* Notifies approver using MS Teams:
  * Main form with links to the incident, product, subscription and subscriber when a subscription is requested
  * Follow message when the subscription is approved/rejected
* Leverages Jira with all the necessary details and links and provides a form to approve/reject with a comment/reason. This uses Jira custom fields. You need to set that up in your Jira instance
* Leverages Jira webhooks to determine when the incident is closed (status = done) to approve/reject the subscription request
* All parameters are environmentalized, including the Jira custom field names
* A comment is added to the Jira incident to indicate that the request was approved/rejected

The API Builder project exposes two API's:

* `POST /api/amplifycentralwebhookhandler` which takes an Amplify subscription webhook as the body. This is the webhook that Amplify calls when a marketplace product subscription request is made.
* `POST /api/approver` which is called automatically when the approver select Approve or Reject button, adds a comment and closes the incident in Jira.

You need to set the following environment variables:

```
CLIENT_ID=DOSA_<An Axway service account client ID>
CLIENT_SECRET=<An Axway service account client Secret>
API_KEY=<An API Key that you set>
API_CENTRAL_URL=https://apicentral.axway.com
MS_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL=<MS Teams channel incoming webhook URL>
BASEURL=<The base URL of your deployed API Builder project>
JIRA_URL=<Base address of your Jira Instance>
JIRA_PROJECT_KEY=<Your Jira Project Key>
JIRA_USERNAME=<Your Jira username>
JIRA_API_TOKEN=<Your Jira API Token>
JIRA_SUBS_APP_COMMENT_FIELD_NAME=<Your Jira custom field name for the Subscription Approval Comment field>
JIRA_SUBS_APP_PICKER_FIELD_NAME=<Your Jira custom field name for the Subscription Approval Picker field>
JIRA_SUBS_NAME_FIELD_NAME=<Your Jira custom field name for the Subscription Name field>
JIRA_SUBS_SELF_LINK_FIELD_NAME=<Your Jira custom field name for the Subscription Self Link field>
JIRA_ISSUE_TYPE=<Your desired Jira Issue Type>
```

For example:

```
CLIENT_ID=DOSA_bc.........56
CLIENT_SECRET=c872...........de8
API_KEY=92........755
MS_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL=https://axwaysoftware.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/bf..........7d/IncomingWebhook/04b.....1/5cf7......65e
API_CENTRAL_URL=https://apicentral.axway.com
BASEURL=https://c5......0.xxxxx.com
JIRA_URL=https://l.....an.atlassian.net/
JIRA_PROJECT_KEY=MSR
JIRA_USERNAME=l.....@gmail.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=I...........8C
JIRA_SUBS_APP_COMMENT_FIELD_NAME=Subscription Approval Comment
JIRA_SUBS_APP_PICKER_FIELD_NAME=Subscription Approval Picker
JIRA_SUBS_NAME_FIELD_NAME=Subscription Name
JIRA_SUBS_SELF_LINK_FIELD_NAME=Subscription Self Link
JIRA_ISSUE_TYPE=Task
```

I configured my Marketplace Subscription Webhook as follows:

```
axway central create -f marketplaceapprovalworflowintegration.yaml
```

`marketplaceapprovalworflowintegration.yaml`

```
group: management
apiVersion: v1alpha1
kind: Integration

> Note: You need to edit the YAML file above and set the API Builder base address and APIKey in the webhook section

> Note that since Jora webhooks don't support authorization headers, I set the API Builder project to no authentication, so the API Key is currently not used or required

The API Builder flow for `/amplifycentralwebhookhandler` is shown below:

The API Builder flow for `/approver` is shown below:

The flows can both certainly be improved by handling errors and other HTTP response status codes better but it demonstrates an MVP for now.
