# Axway Marketplace Subscription Approval Request Workflow using API Builder, MS Teams and Jira

This API Builder project implements the steps described [**here**](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/amplify-central/page/docs/integrate_with_central/webhook/marketplace_subscription_webhook/index.html) to approve Axway Marketplace subscription approval requests. It leverages Jira to present an approval form to the approver:

Note that custom fields are added to Jira to aid in the approval process:

* *approve*/*reject* picker (for user input)
* comments (for user input)
* subscription name (for internal use)
* subscription link (for internal use)

and MS Teams to notify the approval team:

The API Builder project exposes two API's:

* `POST /api/amplifycentralwebhookhandler` which takes an Amplify subscription webhook as the body. This is the webhook that Amplify calls when a marketplace product subscription request is made.
* `POST /api/approver` which is called when the Jira incident is updated. Note that a jira webhook must be configured for this:

You need to set the following environment variables:

```
CLIENT_ID=DOSA_<An Axway service account client ID>
CLIENT_SECRET=<An Axway service account client Secret>
API_KEY=<An API Key that you set>
API_CENTRAL_URL=https://apicentral.axway.com
BASEURL=https://c560-73-227-43-40.ngrok.io
JIRA_URL=<Your Jira instance base URL>
JIRA_PROJECT_KEY=<Your Jira Project Key>
JIRA_USERNAME=<Your Jira Username>
JIRA_API_TOKEN=<Your Jira API Token>
MS_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL=<MS Teams channel incoming webhook URL>
BASEURL=<The base URL of your deployed API Builder project>
```

I configured my Marketplace Subscription Webhook as follows:

```
axway central create -f marketplaceapprovalworflowintegration.yaml
```

`marketplaceapprovalworflowintegration.yaml`

```

> Note: You need to edit the YAML file above and set the API Builder base address and APIKey in the webhook section

The API Builder flow for `/amplifycentralwebhookhandler` is shown below:

The API Builder flow for `/approver` is shown below:

The flows can both certainly be improved by handling errors and other HTTP response status codes better but it demonstrates an MVP for now.
